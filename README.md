# react-component-boilerplate
Boilerplate setup to build a React component for NPM

# Set up with the following commapnds

`npm run build` - This will build the module and throw it into the root `build` folder

`npm  link` - Will create a symlink for the NPM package so other Node environments can access it

`npm link react-component-boilerplate` - This will tie the symlink to the project we're currently in so that we can use it in our test environemnt!

`npm run dev` - Runs a webpack dev server that'll host the component. You can also run `npm run watch` in an adjacent console and edit the component while the webpack dev server hot reloads from the changes you make to the source.

## Enjoy!
